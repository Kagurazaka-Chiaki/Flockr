## 2020/10/16 Friday meeting02

- Main topic: have a initial discussion about the three files' function
  for message.py, user.py and other.py.

- Answers of question from tutor:

  - When removing a message form a channel, the other message_id should not be changed.
  - We can use the int() function to ensure the timestamp takes into account hours, minutes and seconds.
  - The token and u_id in user_profile() function refer to different users.
    The person with "token" is trying to view the profile of "u_id".
  - channel should be determined from the message_id. The message_ia can be started with channel_id.

- Summary of meeting:

  1. have a general understanding of how each function works.
  2. Assign functions for each member to modify based on existing progress:

     - Task Disturbution Form

## 2020/10/22 Thursday meeting06

- Main topic: finish http test and then finsh functions for all files

- Answers of question:

  - we can indicate error reson with something like assert "Invalid token" in payload4.get("message").
  - werkzeug.exceptions appears to just be a module handling errors raised by flask functions,
    dont need to worry about it too much.
  - It is not necessary to store data persistently
    (meaning restarting the server can reset the data to empty if its easier).

- Summary of meeting:

  1. Each member in the group finished the http tests for seperate files and wrote functions for server.py
  2. Each member in the group merged their http tests to the Develop branch,
     and do the same procedure for server.py.

- Questions (ask tutor by email):

  - [ ] We try to indicate the error situation with the code like: assert resp_structure_code == TypeError.code,
        is it reasonable?
        v

- Next meeting time: to be continue âž¡
